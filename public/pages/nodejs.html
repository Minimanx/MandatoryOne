<h1>Node.js</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's JavaScript engine.<br>
    It is 100% serverside and designed to build scalable network applications.<br>
    Node.js uses the Node Package Manager (NPM) CLI to install and manage packages for your apps, among other things.<br>
    <br>
    Node.js uses a file called package.json, located in the root folder of the application, as its build tool. It does 3 things:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Defines dependencies (packages/modules).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Defines the build steps (called "Scripts" in NPM).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Contains the meta data of the project.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
