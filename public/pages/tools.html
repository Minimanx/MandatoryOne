<h2>JSON</h2>
<p>
    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a data format used to store and transfer data, conisting of arrays and key:value pairs.<br>
    As the name may suggest, the format is derived from JavaScribt objects.<br>
    It is especially useful since it is "global" and almost all programming languages have some way of parsing JSON.<br>
