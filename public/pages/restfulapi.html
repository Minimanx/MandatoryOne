<h1>RESTful API</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    REST is an architectural style described by six constraints.<br>
    The constraints are pretty lengthy and complicated, so I won't get into those. You can read about them <a
        href="https://www.restapitutorial.com/">here</a>.
    <br>
    RESTful APIs takes requests of the HTTP CRUD methods to retrieve, modify or create data on the server.<br>
    The most common ones are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>GET</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>POST</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>PUT/PATCH</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>DELETE</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We can also add data to the body of requests, which are then used on our server in whatever way we choose.<br>
    Additionally, it is also possible to send data through the URL in 2 different ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Path Variable
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Query String
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A path variable is information sent after a / in the url as such: <span class="code">www.api.com/apis/1</span> (the
    1 being the variable).<br>
    They are usually used to identify a specific resource, via for example, an ID.<br>
    On the other hand, query strings are usually used for filtering when you're expecting multiple results: <span
        class="code">www.api.com/apis?name=cool</span> (?name=cool being the query).<br>
    This looks at our list and returns all apis that have the name "cool" or contains "cool". That depends on how you
    decide to implement it.
